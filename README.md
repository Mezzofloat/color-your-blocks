This is meant to be an extension to the Colour Your World resource packs seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hVX08jWaHE).

# Why I Did This
One thing that I don't like is how every block is assigned a singular color that defines it. With current Minecraft limitations, this has to be the case, because you can't texture different parts of a block with different resource packs. This mod (and set of resource packs) is meant to fix that, however IT IS VERY, VERY INCOMPLETE SO FAR.
