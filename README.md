# Why I Did This
One thing that I don't like is how every block is assigned a singular color that defines it. In trying to fix this, I will add each texture to multiple colors, and a python script to merge them together. (If you want to, you can create a mod to make this work from entirely within Minecraft. However, that's outside my realm of expertise!)
